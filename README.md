# CNN_Pneumonia_Finder
This is a simple project that uses Convolutional Neural Network to predict via an X-RAY image if the patient has Pneumonia or not.

# Dataset
Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

# More information
This model is obviously not the best, I just wanted to test the accuracy of a simple CNN on X-RAY images.

# TODOs:
* Use transfer learning on network such as VGG16 to highly improve the accuracy of the model
